NORM AND STUFF
- Check Memmory it probably leaks as fuck			- DONE
- Check Norminette						- DONE
- check functions which file should they be in			- DONE
- aka split functions						- DONE
- check structs (pointer vs no pointer)

HANDLING
- average of z values should set z_factor
- size of data file should set zoom
- rotate around mid of solid not around axis			- DONE


BONUS
- automate a random rotation					- DONE
- change colors
- print zoom level and stuff to screen
- add a help on F1
- mouse hook fix						- DONE
- mouse click close add						- DONE
- add comments!


PLAN HO TO FINISH IT!

1 SORT CODE
-------------------
DONE	- create new files
DONE	- move the fucntions
DONE	- add missing function
DONEISH	- check the max line length of functions
DONEISH	- implement the missiong functions in all of the code
DONE	- check if all functions are static if they need to be
DONE	- update h-file
DONE	- implement z scale on startup
DONE 	- fix zoom aka center
DONISH	- norminette should be fine now

2 Rethink Structs
-------------------
DONE	- ptr vs no ptr, etc
DONE	- color to node for bonus
DONE	- all the structs
DONE		- ...
DONE		- ...
DONE		- ...
- check if all mallocs are safe to fail

3 Bonus
-------------------
- Implement Color File
	- change line to print color of node on line
	- function get color for z
	- change color presets by pressing key c or so
- key hold down move change hook
- Print stats to screen
	- maybe hook it to the key i
- Print help to screen
	- maybe hook it to the key F1 or mouse click
DONE	- Animate a zoom in on start and start auto rotate after zoom in
- Animate zoom before closing
- Animate move between presets
- check if map was already createt before
- dash einfuegen

3 COMMENTING
-------------------
- Add the fucked up comments to all the shit!
