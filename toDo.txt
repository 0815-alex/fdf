PLAN HO TO FINISH IT!

1 SORT CODE
-------------------
DONE	- create new files
DONE	- move the fucntions
DONE	- add missing function
DONEISH	- check the max line length of functions
DONEISH	- implement the missiong functions in all of the code
DONE	- check if all functions are static if they need to be
DONE	- update h-file
DONE	- implement z scale on startup
DONE 	- fix zoom aka center
DONISH	- norminette should be fine now

2 Rethink Structs
-------------------
DONE	- ptr vs no ptr, etc
DONE	- color to node for bonus
DONE	- all the structs
DONE		- ...
DONE		- ...
DONE		- ...
- check if all mallocs are safe to fail

3 Bonus
-------------------
DONE	- Implement Color File
DONE		- change line to print color of node on line
DONE		- function get color for z
DONE		- change color presets by pressing key c or so
DONE	- key hold down move change hook
DONE	- Print stats to screen
DONE		- maybe hook it to the key F2
DONE	- Print help to screen
DONE		- maybe hook it to the key F1 or mouse click
DONE	- Animate a zoom in on start and start auto rotate after zoom in
DONE	- Animate zoom before closing
- Animate move between presets
- check if map was already createt before
DONE	- dash einfuegen
DONE	- makefile call minilib make
- color shit an einer linie funktioniert noch nicht wenn r g b unterschiedlich
- check for printf and stuff im not allowed to use

3 COMMENTING
-------------------
- Add the fucked up comments to all the shit!
