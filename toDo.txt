NORM AND STUFF
- Check Memmory it probably leaks as fuck			- DONE
- Check Norminette
- check functions which file should they be in	
- aka split functions
- check structs (pointer vs no pointer)

HANDLING
- average of z values should set z_factor
- size of data file should set zoom
- rotate around mid of solid not around axis			- DONE


BONUS
- automate a random rotation					- DONE
- change colors
- print zoom level and stuff to screen
- add a help on F1
- mouse hook fix						- DONE
- mouse click close add
- add comments!


PLAN HO TO FINISH IT!

1 SORT CODE
-------------------
DONE	- create new files
DONE	- move the fucntions
DONE	- add missing function
DONEISH	- check the max line length of functions
DONEISH	- implement the missiong functions in all of the code
DONE	- check if all functions are static if they need to be
DONE	- update h-file
- implement z scale on startup
- fix zoom aka center
- norminette should be fine now

2 Rethink Structs
-------------------
- ptr vs no ptr, etc
- color to node fo bonus
- all the structs
	- ...
	- ...
	- ...
- check if all mallocs are safe to fail

3 Bonus
-------------------
- Implement Color File
	- change line to print color of node on line
	- function get color for z
	- change color presets by pressing key c or so
- Print stats to screen
	- maybe hook it to the key i
- Print help to screen
	- maybe hook it to the key F1 or mouse click
DONE	- Animate a zoom in on start and start auto rotate after zoom in
- Animate zoom before closing

3 COMMENTING
-------------------
- Add the fucked up comments to all the shit!
